Holiday
=======

Holiday is a library that computes holidays in a very flexible way. It is possible to filter holiday lists by various
criteria and format them in different ways. It is easy to add more holiday providers, filters and formatters, so even
if this library does not perfectly fit your needs, you can simply extend it.

Requirements
------------

- PHP >= 7.1

- Symfony translator in any version is recommended for translations

That's it really.

Installation
------------

Install the library using Composer.

```
composer require umulmrum/holiday
```

Usage
-----

Example:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use umulmrum\Holiday\Calculator\HolidayCalculator;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Filter\IncludeTimespanFilter;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Formatter\DateFormatter;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Provider\Germany\Bavaria;

// Get a HolidayCalculator object and initalize it with one or more holiday providers.
$holidayCalculator = new HolidayCalculator(new Bavaria());
// Calculate the holiday for one year (holidays are always calculated for one year).
$holidays = $holidayCalculator->calculateHolidaysForYear(2016);
// Optionally apply filters, e.g. restrict to one month
$holidays = (new IncludeTimespanFilter())->filter($holidays, [
        IncludeTimespanFilter::PARAM_FIRST_DAY => new DateTime('2016-12-01'),
        IncludeTimespanFilter::PARAM_LAST_DAY => new DateTime('2016-12-31'),
    ]);
// Optionally format the results
$formattedHolidays = (new DateFormatter())->formatList($holidays);

```

This results in an array of date strings that can be echoed or computed further.

There is also a `HolidayHelper` class that simplifies some common holiday
computations. Using the helper, this example can be substituted by this:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use umulmrum\Holiday\Calculator\HolidayCalculator;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Formatter\DateFormatter;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Helper\HolidayHelper;
use umulmrum\Holiday\Provider\Germany\Bavaria;

// Get a HolidayCalculator object and initalize it with one or more holiday providers.
$holidayCalculator = new HolidayCalculator(new Bavaria());
// Get a HolidayHelper object and initalize it with the HolidayCalculator.
$holidayHelper = new HolidayHelper($holidayCalculator);
$holidays = $holidayHelper->getHolidaysForMonth(2016, 12);
// Optionally format the results
$formattedHolidays = (new DateFormatter())->formatList($holidays);

```

Usage normally follows this pattern:

- Compute all holidays for a given year and configured holiday providers.
- Narrow down the list of holidays to the desired subset by using filters.
  Filters can be chained, so that for example all religious holidays in a certain month can be determined by chaining
  a type filter and a time span filter.
  A few filters are provided in this library, more can be added freely.
- Format the result using a formatter.
  A few formatters are provided in this library, more can be added freely.

Filters
-------

Filters can be used to narrow down or transform holiday lists. There are some predefined filters (see `src/Filter`),
but custom ones can be created by implementing `HolidayFilterInterface`.

When implementing custom filters, it is suggested that you use a prefix "Include" in the class name for all filters that
preserve some holidays, e.g. the `IncludeWeekdayFilter` preserves all holidays on a specific weekday. Equally the prefix
"Exclude" should be used for all filters that remove some holidays.

Formatters
----------

Formatters can be used to format holidays and holiday lists. There are some predefined formatters (see `src/Formatter`),
but custom ones can be created by implementing `HolidayFormatterInterface`.

Translations
------------

Some formatters can be initialized with an optional translator. See `TranslatorInterface` and the translation files 
under `res/trans`.
 
Supported Calendars
-------------------

Currently only the Gregorian calendar is supported, for years < 10000.
 
Supported Countries
-------------------

Currently only Germany is supported, but you can easily create your own holiday providers. Just have a look at the
existing code, it should be self-explanatory. I will happily merge pull requests (see below).

Notes on German Holidays
------------------------

- Easter Sunday/Ostersonntag and Whit Sunday/Pfingstsonntag are not public holidays in most states.
- Every sunday is a public holiday in Hesse.
- Assumption/MariÃ¤ Himmelfahrt is a public holiday in about 1700 of about 2000 communities in Bavaria. This is 
  implemented as a partial holiday, so you might want to add your logic that filters this date.
- In Bavaria schools are closed on Assumption Day and on Repentance and Prayer Day. There is no special handling of
  this "behavior".
- Corpus Christi/Fronleichnam is a public holiday in some communities in Saxony and Thuringia.
- Regional holidays with traditionally (but not publicly) limited opening hours are not considered yet (e.g. carnival 
  days).
- Some ports at the German Ocean celebrate some holidays as "High Holidays". It is generally not allowed to work on 
  these days, and work time ends at 12 o'clock the day before. This is not considered yet.
- Also there are some quiet days that are not public holidays in various states. This is also not considered yet.
- New states of Germany are treated as if they had always been part of the Federal Republic of Germany. For years
  before 1990 holidays are therefore not correct.

Notes on Christian Holidays
---------------------------

- Only holidays of Western churches are taken into account.
- Only the most important holidays are taken into account, as interpreted by me (which is most likely far from accurate; 
  please feel free to contribute changes).

Note on Holidays Way in the Past or Future
------------------------------------------

If computing holidays for past years, be aware that they may not be accurate. All holidays were introduced at some 
point, so this lib might return holidays for years in which they really were not in existence, as well as omit holidays
that haven't been celebrated for a long time. This lib aims to be accurate for "recent" years at least, approximately 
for years after World War II.

Likewise holidays might of course change in the future. Also, Easter date calculation will change in the far future due 
to astronomical reasons. So there is no point in calculating holidays for the year 5000 (but in case you wondered: 
Easter Sunday will be on March 30, 5000).

Contribution
------------

- mimic existing code for style and structure
- add unit tests for all of your code
- use the Symfony code style (php-cs-fixer with symfony level)
